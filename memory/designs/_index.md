# Designs Index

This folder contains short design documents capturing trade-offs and configuration for feature areas (e.g., fireworks presets, performance budgets).

- `DES001-fireworks.md` — Fireworks particle presets and performance guidance
- `DES002-atmospheric-overhaul.md` — Aurora, Fog, and Lighting design for Maximalist Winter theme
- `DES003-dynamic-resolution.md` — Dynamic DPR scaling strategy to preserve FPS
- `DES004-pageload-optimization.md` — Lazy scene hydration and startup performance strategy
- `DES005-tdd-adoption.md` — Repository-level TDD adoption (Red → Green → Refactor)
- `DES006-runtime-performance-optimizations.md` — Hotpath optimization decisions (SoA fireworks, instancing updates, GPU tuning)

Add additional design documents here as features evolve.
