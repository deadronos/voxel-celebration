# Performance Optimization (Deprecated as instructions)

This repository no longer applies a global, always-on performance optimization instruction set.

- Use the skill: `.github/skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md`.
- Use the deeper reference (when needed): `.github/skills/performance-optimization/references/performance-optimization.md`.
